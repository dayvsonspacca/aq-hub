# AQ Hub

AQ Hub is a web application dedicated to **AdventureQuest Worlds (AQW)**. Its main goal is to serve as a **wiki-style resource for the game**, providing structured and easy-to-access information for players. While inspired by the existing AQW Wiki, AQ Hub focuses on offering a more streamlined, consistent, and beginner-friendly experience.
