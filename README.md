# AQ Hub

AQ Hub is a web application focused on **AdventureQuest Worlds (AQW)**. Its primary goal is to serve as a **wiki for the game**, offering structured and easy-to-access information for players. Unlike the current AQW wiki, which has some gaps and inconsistencies, AQ Hub aims to provide a more complete and reliable source of information.  

## Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive and organized database of AQW items, quests, and characters.  
- Deliver an intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing game information.  
- Offer search and filtering tools to help players quickly find what they need.  
- Continuously expand content to cover all aspects of the game in detail.  
- Maintain a consistent and up-to-date resource for both new and experienced players.  

## Features (Planned / Current)

- AQW item database  
- Quest and character information  
- Search and filter functionality
